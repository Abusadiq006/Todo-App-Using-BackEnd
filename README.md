Features:-
Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks
Persistent task storage using a SQL database
Simplified data access with Prisma ORM
Containerized deployment with Docker for consistency
RESTful API for seamless task management

Tech Stack:-
Backend: JavaScript (Node.js)
ORM: Prisma
Database: SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL)
Containerization: Docker
Runtime: Node.js

Prerequisites:-
Node.js (v16 or higher)
Docker and Docker Compose
A SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
Prisma CLI (npm install -g @prisma/cli)

InstallationClone the repository:bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app-using-backend.git
cd todo-app-using-backend

Install dependencies:bash

npm install

Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add:env

DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"
PORT=3000

Replace your-database-connection-string with your SQL database connection URL (e.g., postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/tododb).
Run Prisma migrations:bash

npx prisma migrate dev --name init

Build and run with Docker:bash

docker-compose up --build

This starts the app and database containers as defined in docker-compose.yml.

Usage
1. The app runs on http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in .env).
2. Use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API.
3. To stop the application, press Ctrl+C or run:bash

docker-compose down

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/your-feature).
3. Commit your changes (git commit -m "Add your feature").
4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/your-feature).
5. Open a pull request.

Notes:
1. App Name: Updated to "Todo-App Using BackEnd" throughout the README.

2. Placeholders: Replace your-username with your GitHub username and your-database-connection-string with your actual database URL.
3. Database: Assumed a generic SQL database. If you’re using PostgreSQL, MySQL, or another, I can specify that in the README.
4. API Endpoints: Included standard CRUD endpoints. If your app has unique endpoints or additional features (e.g., authentication, filtering), share them, and I’ll update the list.
5. Docker Files: Assumed you have a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml. If you need sample files for these, let me know, and I can provide them.
6. Frontend: Since you mentioned a backend focus, I kept the README backend-centric. If there’s a frontend, let me know to include relevant details.

If you need further tweaks (e.g., adding testing instructions, deployment steps, or a specific section), or if you want me to generate supporting files like docker-compose.yml, just let me know!
